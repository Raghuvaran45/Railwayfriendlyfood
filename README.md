🚆 Railway Friendly Food (RFF)
📌 Project Overview
Railway Friendly Food (RFF) is a front-end web application that allows railway passengers to order fresh meals during their train journey.

The platform enables users to:


   1.Log in or create an account
   2.Enter train and journey details
   3.Pre-order food before reaching a station
   4.Order food during the journey
   5.Subscribe to premium plans for discounts and priority delivery

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without backend integration (currently frontend-based with mock data).

🎯 Problem Statement

Train passengers often struggle to find hygienic and timely food during long journeys. RFF provides a digital solution that connects passengers with nearby restaurants and enables food delivery directly to their seat at selected stations.
